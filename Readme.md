# A New Developmentalist model of structural change, economic growth and middle-income traps in python

This is a recreation of the model presented in [Oreiro, da Silva and Dávila-Fernández (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0954349X20303830) to illustrate the mechanism of the middle income trap.

The model describes the macroeconomic dynamics of a country that suffers from de-industrialization and slow economic growth due to a chronic overvaluation of the currency arising from dutch disease, or from a strategy of external savings (current account deficits).

The paper's dynamics are in continuous time, while this implementation is in discrete time for implementation and simulation using the [pysolve](https://github.com/kennt/pylinsolve) python package.

This repository contains the model in the `new_develomentalist_model` module, and illustrative simulations and plots in the ipython notebook.
